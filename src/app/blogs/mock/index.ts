      "A detailed comparison of REST and GraphQL, their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.",
    tags: ["API", "REST", "GraphQL", "Web Development", "Backend"],
    readTime: 8,
    content: `
            <p>APIs are the backbone of modern web and mobile applications, enabling communication between the frontend and backend. Two of the most popular approaches are REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL. While REST has been the standard for decades, GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative with greater flexibility.</p>
            
            <h2>What is REST?</h2>
            <p>REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URLs. It has been the industry standard for building APIs due to its simplicity and wide adoption.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple, predictable, and well-supported across platforms.</li>
              <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Over-fetching or under-fetching data is common, and multiple requests may be needed to gather related resources.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>
            <p>GraphQL, created by Facebook, is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single query. Instead of multiple endpoints, GraphQL APIs expose a single endpoint for flexible queries.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Eliminates over-fetching, reduces network requests, and provides strong typing with introspection.</li>
              <li><strong>Cons:</strong> More complex setup, potential performance issues for poorly optimized queries, and a steeper learning curve.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Key Differences</h2>

                  <td>Complex apps with dynamic data needs.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <h2>When to Use REST vs GraphQL</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use REST</strong> when building lightweight applications, microservices, or APIs that donâ€™t require highly customized data fetching.</li>
              <li><strong>Use GraphQL</strong> when building complex frontends (like dashboards, mobile apps, or data-heavy UIs) where minimizing requests and tailoring responses is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To set up a REST API, you can use frameworks like <code>Express.js</code> or <code>Django REST Framework</code>. For GraphQL, libraries like <code>Apollo Server</code> or <code>GraphQL Yoga</code> provide excellent developer tools and integrations.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>REST remains reliable, mature, and suitable for many projects, while GraphQL introduces flexibility and efficiency for complex data requirements. The best choice depends on your application's scale, complexity, and performance needs.</p>
